# Crayon

Crayon is a stack-based programming language based on a 2-dimensional output canvas of text. More spec will come soon, then an interpreter sometime later.

## Spec
- [Data types](https://github.com/ETHproductions/Crayon/blob/master/docs/Data%20types.md)
- [Operators](https://github.com/ETHproductions/Crayon/blob/master/docs/Operators.md)
- [Encoding](https://github.com/ETHproductions/Crayon/blob/master/docs/Encoding.md)

Suggestions are welcome for anything.
