#### Data types

There are three main data types in Crayon:

- [String/Pattern](https://github.com/ETHproductions/Crayon/blob/master/docs/Strings.md): Used like strings in most other languages, but have special properties when drawn to the canvas.
- Number: Floating-point numbers, handled as in JS.
- Array: An array of strings, numbers, and/or arrays. The stack is an array of sorts.
- [Regex](https://github.com/ETHproductions/Crayon/blob/master/docs/Regexes.md): Used like regexes in most other languages, but have special 2-dimensional features.
